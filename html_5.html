<!-- progress element allows for creation of progress bars on the web
web storage API - it allows storage of data on a users local computer. before html5 we had to use javascript cookies to achieve this functionality.

(advantages of web storage)
1. more secure
2. faster
3. stores a larger amount of data 
4. stored data is not sent with every server request 
--All storage is per domain and all pages from one domain can store and access the same data.

(types of web storage objects)
1. session storage()- session storage is destroyed once the user exits the browser.
2. local storage() - stores data with no expiration
-- You need to familiarize with javascript in order to use the api.

the syntax for the web storage is very clear. data is stored as a key value pairs. The same syntax applies to the session storage and only change the name localstorage to sessionstorage

1. storing a value - localstorage.setitem("key1", "value1");
2. getting a value - alert(localstorage.getitem("key1"));  this will print the value.
3. removing a value - localstorage.removeitem("key1");
4. removing all values - localstorage.clear();

<!-- GEOLOCATION API - used to get the users current location.
    the main method is the getCurrentPosition which retrieves the current geolocation of the user's device.

    (parameter)
    1. showlocation - mandatory
    2. errorhandler - optional
    3. options - optional

 User location can be presented in two ways; geodetic and civic. 
 geodetic describes directly the latitude and longitude.
 civic describes a format that is easily understood by the average person.
